# 🌿 ZenFocus: Daily Vibe & Inspiration

A minimalist, high-end web application designed to help developers and students find a moment of focus. ZenFocus delivers a fresh, aesthetic background paired with a random piece of life advice.



## 🚀 Features
* **Dynamic Glassmorphism UI:** Modern interface using CSS backdrop-filters for a sleek look.
* **Hybrid Data Architecture:** Combines a local high-quality image gallery with real-time API data.
* **Asynchronous Logic:** Uses `async/await` and the `Fetch API` to handle data transitions smoothly.
* **Network Resiliency:** Built-in error handling (Try/Catch) to manage fluctuating internet connections.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** Custom Flexbox layouts and CSS transitions.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Clean, modern JS without heavy frameworks.
* **Advice Slip API:** For generating real-time motivational content.

## 🧠 What I Learned
During this project, I focused on "Thinking Before Coding." I tackled challenges like:
1.  **Handling API Failures:** Managing 404 errors by sanitizing my image data array.
2.  **Optimizing for Slow Networks:** Learning how to manage large image loads on limited bandwidth (Glo network struggles!).
3.  **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically updating background styles and text content without page refreshes.

## 💻 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` using a local server (like VS Code Live Server).
3. Click "New Vibe" to refresh your perspective!
